## 💬 HARD QUESTIONS TO PREPARE FOR

### **On Competition:**

**Q: "Why won't LinkedIn just pivot to a trust economy model?"**
**A:** "LinkedIn generated $15B from their attention economy model. Their shareholders won't accept pivoting away from that revenue. They'd have to abandon their core business model. We're building the trust economy from scratch - no legacy to protect, no shareholders demanding ad revenue growth. Plus, their reputation is damaged. Users won't believe 'new ethical LinkedIn.' We have the credibility of starting fresh with the right model from day one."

**Q: "What if OpenAI or Google builds this?"**
**A:** "OpenAI made $1.6B in 2023 with generic AI. We're building 100+ profession-specific AI personalities trained on actual professional interactions - that's a $1.355B revenue opportunity by Year 5. Plus, we have the trust economy infrastructure they don't: virtuous business cycles, anti-addiction design, local community integration. They're focused on AI technology; we're building economic infrastructure. Different game entirely."

**Q: "Isn't the market too crowded? So many social networks."**
**A:** "We're not building another social network - we're replacing the broken economic model underneath all of them. The attention economy generates $200B+ annually but creates $2.4B in mental health costs. We're building the trust economy infrastructure. Every existing platform is built on the wrong foundation. We're offering the right foundation. That's a greenfield opportunity."

### **On Traction:**

**Q: "Why only 250 waitlist signups?"**
**A:** "We're pre-launch and haven't started marketing yet. Those 250 are organic signups from word-of-mouth and early demos. More importantly, we have 40+ local businesses committed to World Boulevard - that's real commercial traction. Post-funding, we're allocating 35% ($525K) to marketing and user acquisition. Conservative goal: 10,000 active users within 18 months."

**Q: "How will you acquire users across 3 platforms?"**
**A:** "Three acquisition strategies: 1) **ÁGORA:** Professional networks and LinkedIn alternative positioning, 2) **World Boulevard:** B2B sales to local businesses (they bring customers), 3) **You Are Not Alone:** Community partnerships and grassroots organizing. The virtuous cycle is key: businesses on World Boulevard fund user acquisition on ÁGORA organically. We're not fighting for attention - we're building sustainable community infrastructure."

**Q: "What's your timeline to revenue?"**
**A:** "First revenue in Month 2-3 (World Boulevard business subscriptions at $49-$199/mo). Meaningful revenue ($25K+ MRR) by Month 9-12 as we hit 500+ businesses and 5,000+ users. AI personality premium features start Month 6. Conservative Year 1: $22M revenue. Year 2: $89M. Year 5: $1.8B. Series A at 18 months with strong traction and clear path to profitability."

### **On Team:**

**Q: "Tell me about your team."**
**A:** "Two co-founders: I'm Dr. Juan de J. Sanchez (Founder & CEO) - physician and mental health specialist with technical skills. Built the entire platform myself (31 database tables, 82 React components). Allan Viquez is VP Marketing & Operations - multilingual marketing expert. Post-funding, we're hiring 4 key roles: CTO, AI/ML Engineer, Backend Engineer, Marketing Manager. We've de-risked technical execution - platforms are built. Now we need capital to scale the team."

**Q: "Do you have technical expertise?"**
**A:** "Yes. I built the entire platform myself: 31 database tables, 82 React components, 3 Supabase Edge Functions, 8 AI personalities, full authentication, API gateway, anti-addiction architecture. I'm comfortable with code but recognize we need specialized talent (AI/ML, DevOps, Infrastructure) to scale to 100+ AI personalities and millions of users. That's what seed funding enables."

**Q: "What happens if you get hit by a bus?"**
**A:** "All code is in GitHub, fully documented. Allan Viquez (VP Marketing & Operations) can manage day-to-day operations. Architecture is clean and maintainable. Any senior engineer could take over technical execution. That said, seed funding includes hiring a CTO who will own technical roadmap, significantly reducing key person risk. Plus, we're building infrastructure, not a personality-driven consumer brand."

### **On Business Model:**

**Q: "How do you monetize with a trust economy model?"**
**A:** "Five revenue streams totaling $1.8B by Year 5: 1) **B2C subscriptions** ($615M) - Premium features on ÁGORA, 2) **API ecosystem** ($475M) - 70/30 split with 1,000+ developers, 3) **Specialized AI personalities** ($355M) - Professional AI assistants, 4) **Business subscriptions** ($270M) - World Boulevard business memberships, 5) **Enterprise solutions** ($85M) - White-label platforms. Revenue from delivering value, not selling attention."

**Q: "How do you prevent churn?"**
**A:** "The virtuous business cycle creates natural retention. Local businesses on World Boulevard attract users to ÁGORA. Users on ÁGORA discover businesses. Community projects on You Are Not Alone strengthen both. It's a self-reinforcing ecosystem, not a single-use app. Plus, anti-addiction design means users trust us - trust creates loyalty. Projected churn: <15% annually (vs 30-50% for attention economy platforms)."

**Q: "What's your CAC and LTV?"**
**A:** "CAC: $12-$35 per user (content marketing, community partnerships, B2B referrals from World Boulevard). LTV: ÁGORA Premium = $9.99/mo × 48 months × 85% retention = $407. Business subscriptions = $149/mo × 60 months × 90% retention = $8,046. LTV/CAC ratios: Consumer = 12-34x, Business = 230-670x. The virtuous cycle dramatically reduces CAC over time because businesses organically recruit users."

### **On Market:**

**Q: "How big is the market really?"**
**A:** "TAM = $850B (global social media market moving from attention to trust economy). SAM = $180B (LinkedIn $15B + local business discovery + community organizing + specialized AI). SOM (Year 5) = $1.8B across our 5 revenue streams. Comparable validations: OpenAI ($1.6B with generic AI), LinkedIn ($15B with closed platform), Stripe ($14B with payment infrastructure). We're combining all three models: AI + networking + infrastructure."

**Q: "Why now? Why hasn't someone done this before?"**
**A:** "Four converging forces: 1) **Mental health crisis** attributed to social media reached critical mass (governments regulating), 2) **Trust collapse** - 73% of users distrust current platforms, 3) **AI maturation** - enables specialized personalities at scale, 4) **Regulatory tailwind** - EU Digital Services Act, Canada Bill C-27 forcing change. We're not fighting the tide - we're riding it. Perfect timing to replace broken infrastructure."

### **On The Raise:**

**Q: "Why $1.5M? Why not more or less?"**
**A:** "$1.5M @ $10M post-money (15% equity) gives us 18-month runway to hit Series A milestones: 10,000 active users, 100+ businesses, $25K+ MRR, 100 API ecosystem developers. Breakdown: 40% team ($600K), 35% marketing ($525K), 15% tech ($225K), 10% legal/IP ($150K). We're capital efficient but ambitious. Less = can't scale fast enough. More = unnecessary dilution. This is the optimal amount."

**Q: "Is $10M post-money valuation justified?"**
**A:** "Yes. Comparables: Stripe (2010 seed @ $20M pre-revenue), Airbnb (2009 seed @ $2.6M), Uber (2010 seed @ $5M). We have 3 working platforms, 250+ waitlist, 40+ business commitments, 8 AI personalities operational, clear path to $1.8B Year 5 revenue, and 7 layers of defensibility. At 15% equity ($1.5M @ $10M post-money), investors get: Series A at $75M (7.5x), Exit Year 5 at $14.4B-$108B (960x-7,200x potential return). Underpriced if anything."

**Q: "What happens if you can't raise?"**
**A:** "Plan B: Pursue $200K-$800K in non-dilutive Canadian grants (NRC-IRAP, OCI, FedDev Ontario). Scale slower but still viable. Plan C: Launch World Boulevard first (B2B revenue), use cash flow to fund ÁGORA and You Are Not Alone. Slower but self-sustaining. But I'm confident we'll close this round - the market timing is perfect, the problem is massive, and we have the only credible solution. This is a once-in-a-decade infrastructure replacement opportunity."

## 🎬 DEMO SCRIPT (8-Minute Live Walkthrough)

### **Minute 1: Developer Portal Overview**
"Let me show you our live platform. This is our Developer Dashboard - fully functional right now. Here you can see API usage stats, create API keys, view analytics."

### **Minute 2-3: API Documentation**
"Click on API Docs tab. Here's our complete documentation for all three APIs. Notice the copy-paste examples, authentication details, rate limits - everything a developer needs."

### **Minute 4-5: Live AI Generation API Call**
"Let me show you a live API call. Here's a curl command to our AI Generation API. Personality: healthcare-specialist, context: patient-onboarding, message: nutrition advice. Watch this..."
*(Execute curl command, show response in real-time)*
"See? Response in 234 milliseconds. Notice the confidence score, token usage, suggestions - all trackable and billable."

### **Minute 6-7: Matching API Demo**
"Now let me show our Matching API. This takes a user ID, filters by industry and goals, returns compatible matches with scores. Here..."
*(Execute curl command, show response)*
"87% match score based on 4 compatibility factors. Match reasons explain why. Suggested topics for conversation. This is intelligence you can't get from LinkedIn or generic AI."

### **Minute 8: Analytics Dashboard**
"Finally, our Analytics API. Developers can query their usage, costs, performance metrics, get AI-powered recommendations. This creates stickiness - they rely on our insights to optimize their apps."

**Key Demo Tips:**
✓ Have commands pre-written (don't type live, just paste)
✓ Use pretty-print for JSON responses
✓ Explain what's happening as results load
✓ Point out differentiated features
✓ Keep energy high (enthusiasm is contagious)

## 💡 FINAL PRO TIPS

1. **Control the narrative:** Don't let them derail you. Answer questions but bring it back to your key points.

2. **Show confidence but not arrogance:** You're solving a real problem. Own it. But stay humble and coachable.

3. **Ask questions too:** Fundraising is two-way. You're evaluating them as much as they're evaluating you.

4. **Don't bad-mouth competitors:** LinkedIn, Tinder, OpenAI are successful companies. Respect them, but show how you're different.

5. **Be honest about unknowns:** If you don't know something, say "Great question, I don't have that data yet but I'll get it to you by [date]."

6. **Energy matters:** VCs invest in people they believe in. Show passion, conviction, and energy.

7. **Follow up relentlessly:** 80% of term sheets come after 5+ touchpoints. Don't give up after one meeting.

8. **Create urgency (if true):** If you have other interested investors, mention it. FOMO works on VCs too.

**Remember:** You've built something real. You have working APIs, a clear business model, and a big vision. Walk into every meeting knowing you're offering them an opportunity to invest in something special.

**You got this, Dr. Sánchez!** 🚀
