## 🤝 WARM INTRO STRATEGY

**Warm intros = 10x better response rate than cold emails**

### **How to Find Warm Intro Paths:**

1. **LinkedIn 2nd-degree connections:**
   - Go to investor's LinkedIn profile
   - Click "See all X connections"
   - Filter for mutual connections
   - Identify who can introduce you

2. **Alumni networks:**
   - Search "[Your University] alumni at [VC Firm]"
   - Reach out via alumni association
   - Mention shared university connection

3. **Portfolio company founders:**
   - Find founders of companies in their portfolio
   - DM them on LinkedIn or Twitter
   - Ask if they'd introduce you to their investor

4. **Accelerators/Incubators:**
   - If you've been through Y Combinator, Techstars, etc.
   - Leverage alumni network for intros
   - YC founders are very helpful with VC intros

### **Warm Intro Request Template:**

```
Hi [Connector Name],

Hope you're doing well!

I'm raising our seed round for HUMANBIBLIO (trust economy platform replacing attention-based social media) and I noticed you're connected to [Investor Name] at [VC Firm] on LinkedIn.

[VC Firm]'s focus on [infrastructure platforms / ethical tech / healthcare AI] makes them a perfect fit for us. We're projecting $1.8B Year 5 revenue across 3 integrated platforms.

Would you be comfortable making a warm intro? Happy to provide:
• One-pager (attached)
• Technical pitch deck
• Any specific info they'd want

No pressure at all - I completely understand if timing isn't right!

Thanks,
Dr. Juan de J. Sanchez
```

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Spray and pray:** Don't send 100 generic emails. Better to send 30 personalized emails.

2. **Giving up too early:** 80% of deals happen at follow-up #3-5. Don't stop at one email.

3. **Not tracking outreach:** Use spreadsheet or Supabase to track every contact. You'll forget otherwise.

4. **Being defensive:** When VCs ask hard questions, don't get defensive. It's their job to poke holes.

5. **Taking too long:** Fundraising loses momentum. Strike while iron is hot. Move fast.

6. **Not creating urgency:** If you have interested investors, tell others. FOMO works on VCs.

7. **Bad follow-up:** Send thank you email within 2 hours of every meeting. Always.

8. **Ignoring rejections:** If someone passes, ask why. Feedback is valuable.

9. **Burning bridges:** Today's "no" might be tomorrow's "yes" at Series A. Stay gracious.

10. **Not asking for intros:** If a VC passes, ask "Who else should I talk to?" They often give referrals.

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **You're on track if:**
✓ 30+ investors contacted in first 2 weeks
✓ 5+ meetings scheduled by Week 3
✓ 2+ deep dive meetings by Week 4
✓ 1+ partner meeting by Week 5
✓ 2+ term sheets by Week 6-7
✓ Round closed by Week 8-10

### **Red flags if:**
❌ <5% response rate to emails (improve personalization)
❌ No meetings after 20+ emails (pitch is off)
❌ Meetings but no second meetings (demo isn't compelling)
❌ Second meetings but no term sheets (valuation too high or not investable)

---

## 💡 FINAL TIPS

1. **Start today, not tomorrow:** Fundraising takes longer than you think. Start now.

2. **Parallel process:** Contact multiple investors simultaneously. Don't wait for one to say no.

3. **Build in public:** Post on LinkedIn about your journey. Builds credibility and attracts inbound interest.

4. **Focus on Canadian VCs first:** Easier to access, understand local market, faster decisions.

5. **Government grants in parallel:** Non-dilutive funding extends runway. Apply while fundraising.

6. **Practice makes perfect:** The more pitches you give, the better you get. First 3 will be rough. That's okay.

7. **Energy management:** Fundraising is exhausting. Take breaks, exercise, sleep well. You need to be sharp.

8. **Celebrate small wins:** First email sent, first meeting scheduled, first term sheet. Celebrate progress.
